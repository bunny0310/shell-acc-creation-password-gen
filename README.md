# shell scripts
This repository just contains a bunch of shell scripts I created while doing the shell scripting course from Udemy. I dealt with different
concepts and commands including but not limited to positional parameters, GETOPTS, loops and conditionals, creating and deleting accounts,
awk and cut commands etc
